# NYC-MOTOR-COLLISIONS-POWER-BI

Let's delve into each component of this PowerBI report:

KPI (Key Performance Indicator) Cards:

"Total Deaths" (1,577) and "Total Injuries" (329K) are displayed prominently in large font, providing a quick snapshot of the gravity of vehicle collisions in terms of human impact.

"Fatality Rate" is presented as 0.48, though the context (per 100 collisions, per year, etc.) is not specified in the image.

"Most Collisions Occur at" indicates the time of day when the most collisions happen, here shown as 4:00:00 PM. This is a critical piece of information for possibly targeting safety measures.

Line Chart - Injuries and Deaths Over Time:

This dual-axis line chart tracks the number of injuries and deaths from 2014 to 2022. The red line likely represents injuries, and the grey line represents deaths based on the color of the dots on the lines.

The y-axis represents the count of incidents, while the x-axis represents time. This visualization is useful for observing trends and identifying if there are specific times where peaks occur, which might correlate with external factors like holidays or weather conditions.

Bar Charts:

"Total Injuries by Borough" uses a vertical bar chart to compare injuries across five boroughs. Brooklyn has the highest count (118K), followed by Queens (94K), the Bronx (52K), Manhattan (51K), and Staten Island (14K). Such a chart helps in pinpointing areas that may require more attention regarding road safety.

"Cyclists, Motorists, Pedestrians Killed" uses a horizontal bar chart, where the length of the bars represents the number of fatalities within each category. Cyclists have the least (147), whereas pedestrians have the most (853), indicating a critical area for intervention.

Pie Charts:

"Contributing Factor to Collisions" is shown with a pie chart, where the largest segment is "Unspecified" (46.52%), indicating a large number of reports did not have a clear contributing factor. The next largest is "Driver Inattention/Distraction" (26.25%), a significant insight for traffic safety campaigns.

"Type of Vehicles Causing collisions" is displayed with a donut chart, with "Sedan" being the most common type of vehicle involved in collisions (30.89%). This visualization aids in understanding which vehicles are most often involved and could be targeted for safety improvements.

Filters and Slicers:

The report includes interactive slicers for "Borough" and "Date", which suggests that the viewer can select specific boroughs or date ranges to refine the data displayed in the visualizations. These slicers are critical for drilling down into the data to analyze specific subsets or to observe trends over time.

Each element of this report offers a different lens through which to view and understand the data. The combination of these visualizations provides a multi-faceted analysis of vehicle collisions in NYC, highlighting the key figures, trends over time, geographical distribution, and factors contributing to these events. The interactivity implied by the slicers would enable users to engage with the data actively, making the report a dynamic tool for analysis and decision-making.
